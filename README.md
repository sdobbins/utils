# utils

My set of standard util functions. 

The most useful are probably:
- the level- and factor-handling functions in utils.factors.R, 
- the easy regex functions in utils_regex.R, 
- the mapped logic functions in utils_logicals.R, 
- and the infix operators in utils_general.R among others. 

Enjoy!
